# RISCV-Core

My very first RISC-V core

## Version-1

This version has both memory and core inside the same module.\
It has word addressable memory.\
This core does not support Syscall and Fence Instructions.

## Version-2

This version is same as Version-1 but has byte addressable memory.\
This core does not support Syscall and Fence Instructions.

## Version-3

In This Version 5-Stages have been implementated without Data and Control Hazard Units.
This version should be run using nop(No Operation).
